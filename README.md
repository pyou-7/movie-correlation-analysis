# Movie Correlation Data Analysis and Visualization

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of a movie dataset using Python. The goal is to explore the data, identify any missing values, detect outliers, and understand relationships between various movie features through visualizations. The project leverages libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib to perform data manipulation and create insightful visualizations.

## Features

- **Data Import and Preparation**: Importing necessary packages and reading the movie dataset.
- **Data Cleaning and Outlier Detection**: Handling missing data and detecting outliers using box plots.
- **Data Visualization**: Creating scatter plots, correlation matrices, and heatmaps to visualize data relationships.
- **Insights and Analysis**: Identifying and interpreting correlations between different features.
